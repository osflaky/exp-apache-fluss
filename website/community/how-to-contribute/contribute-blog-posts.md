# Contribute Blog Posts

The [Apache Fluss blog](https://fluss.apache.org/blog) is a space for the community to share use cases, deep dives, release announcements, and project updates. Blog posts are authored by community members and reviewed by committers before being published.

This guide walks you through submitting a blog post, from proposing the topic to getting it live on the site.

Blog content lives in its own repository, [apache/fluss-blog](https://github.com/apache/fluss-blog), which is a Docusaurus 3 site built and deployed separately from the main documentation.

## Propose Your Topic First

Before writing, open an issue in [apache/fluss-blog](https://github.com/apache/fluss-blog/issues) describing the post you would like to write. Include:

- A working title.
- A short summary (a few sentences) of what you plan to cover.
- Whether the post is a tutorial, case study, deep dive, release note, or something else.
- A target length and any code samples or diagrams you plan to include.

Getting feedback early avoids two people writing the same post and gives committers a chance to flag overlap with upcoming announcements.

## Fork and Clone the Blog Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/fluss-blog.git
cd fluss-blog
npm install
npm run start
```

The development server runs at `http://localhost:3000` with hot reload, so edits show up immediately.

## Repository Layout

```

└── package.json
```

## Write the Post

### 1. Create the Markdown file

Add a new file under `blog/` using this naming convention:

```
blog/YYYY-MM-DD-my-post-slug.md
```

Use the date you expect the post to be merged and a short, URL-safe slug.

### 2. Add frontmatter

Every post must start with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
slug: my-post-slug
title: "My Blog Post Title"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
authors: [your_key]
tags: [engineering]
description: "A short summary explaining what readers will learn from this post."
image: ./assets/my_post/banner.png
---
```

- `slug` — URL path for the post (for example, `/blog/my-post-slug`).
- `authors` — List of author keys defined in `blog/authors.yml`.
- `tags` — One or two category keys from the four categories below.
- `description` — One concise sentence (roughly 120–200 characters) for the homepage card and social sharing.
- `image` — Cover image for the homepage and social sharing. Use an explicit banner path; posts in `blog/releases/` should use `./../assets/<my_post>/banner.png` so Docusaurus bundles the image.

### 3. Add images

Place post-specific images in `blog/assets/<post_name>/` and reference them with relative paths from the post:

```markdown
![My Diagram](assets/my_post/diagram.png)
```

Use a **1200 × 510 px** canvas (40:17, approximately 2.35:1) for blog banners, or **2400 × 1020 px** for high-density screens. Keep titles and logos at least 60 px from the edges of the smaller canvas, and use a short headline that remains legible at a card width of about 400 px. Aim for a compressed image below 300 KB where possible.

The homepage fits the complete image into a fixed banner frame. Older images with different ratios have padding. For a full-bleed cover, compose a separate banner for this canvas and reference it in `image`; preserve the original illustration in the article body. Avoid stretching images or cropping titles and logos to force a different ratio.

### 4. Add yourself as an author

If this is your first post, add an entry to `blog/authors.yml`:

```yaml
your_key:
  name: Your Name
  title: Your Title
  url: https://github.com/your-github
  image_url: /avatars/your-avatar.png
```

Place your avatar image in `blog/static/avatars/`.

### 5. Choose categories

Choose one primary category and, when useful, one secondary category from `blog/tags.yml`:

| Key | Label | Use for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `announcement` | Announcement | Releases, project milestones, and official announcements |
| `case-study` | Case Study | Enterprise case studies and production practices |
| `engineering` | Engineering | Architecture, system internals, and technical deep dives |
| `guides` | Guides | Getting started, how-to guides, application patterns, and best practices |

Keep the taxonomy limited to these four categories. Put technology names such as Flink, Iceberg, Rust, or Arrow in the title, summary, or article text. For example, a graduation announcement uses `[announcement]`; a production tuning deep dive can use `[engineering, guides]`.

## Preview and Build Locally

```bash
# Production build
npm run build

# Preview the production build locally
npm run serve
```

Run the production build before opening a pull request; the Docusaurus build catches broken links, missing frontmatter fields, and other issues the dev server does not.

## Submitting Your Post

1. Commit your changes with a descriptive message:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "blog: add post on <topic>"
```

2. Push to your fork:

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

3. Open a pull request against [apache/fluss-blog](https://github.com/apache/fluss-blog), linking the topic issue you opened earlier.

## Review and Publication

Committers review the post for technical accuracy, tone, and fit with the broader project narrative. Expect light copy edits; substantive feedback comes first in the linked issue.

Once the pull request merges into `main`, a CI pipeline automatically builds and publishes the new content to the [Apache Fluss website](https://fluss.apache.org/blog). No manual deploy step is required.
